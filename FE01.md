## Challenge

> You are given a `fe01.ost` file. Step one is to figure out what it is and how to open it.

## Solution
A quick search tells us that a .ost file is an Outlook save of an Outlook profile.  
How to open this? Either use an OST viewer, or use Outlook itself. I don't have Outlook, so an OST viewer it was.
I chose Kernel OST Viewer because it's free and looked legit. 

After opening, you have to dig through some emails until you can find one holding `flag.zip`.
Once this is found, you have to save it to disk, and fo find a password for the zip. 
The password string will be located in a calendar appointment.
Extracting the zip gives you `flag.jpg`.

FLAG: pst_i'm_in_here!
