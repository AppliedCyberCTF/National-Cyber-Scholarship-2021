* **Category:** Binary Hard 01 (BH02)
* **Points:** 500pts

## Challenge

> The only given is an ELF binary named `program`. Running the binary `chmod +x program`, `./program` gives you this:

>
> The program allows you to enter a string, and responds with an obfuscated string.
## Solution
I did not use the intended solution, I merely got 90% of the answer and then brute forced it.
By spamming the prompt with text, I was able to get this much of the flag:

At this point, `aLittLeObfuScatIonalCha` was enough to guess that the last part would be some variation of `Character`.
Guessing gave me `aLittLeObfuScatIonalCharActEr`, and there was the flag!

FLAG: aLittLeObfuScatIonalCharActEr
