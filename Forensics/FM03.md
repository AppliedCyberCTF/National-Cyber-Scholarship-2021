## Challenge
> Download the file `dir_volume` and find a way to get the flag.

## FM03 Hint
During the competition, the following hint was emailed out:
> **Hint:** It's a Veracrypt encrypted volume ðŸ¤”

## Solution
This disk is a Veracrypt encrypted volume, protected with a password. 
Brute-force the password using `Hashcat` and the `rockyou` word list, to get the phrase "redwings". 

`sudo hashcat -a 0 -m 13722 dirvolume /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force`

And the output you get:
```
Dirvolume:redwings

```
Download the Veracrypt encryption software and open the disk volume using the password. 
The flag folder will be located within the root directory. Open the text file within the folder to get the flag.

```
Flag: `Us3_5tr0ng_P@55w0Rds!`
