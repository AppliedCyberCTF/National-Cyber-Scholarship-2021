## Challenge

> Download the file and find a way to get the flag.

## Solution
I noticed in the windows file explorer the thumbnail of the file showed the flag.
![](./../assets/fm01.png)
Upon opening the jpeg we are greeted with the colors of the rainbow splashed everywhere not the image from the thumbnail.

I tried zooming into the thumbnail and guessed the flag from what I could make out.
However this was definitely not the intended sol so knowing that image thumbnails are sometimes stored as metadata that was my next move.

Simply using `exiftool` to view the metadata
> `exiftool fm01.jpg`

And in the ouput we see
