## Challenge

> Download the file and find a way to get the flag.

## Solution
I noticed in the windows file explorer the thumbnail of the file showed the flag.\
![](../assets/fm01.png)\
Upon opening the jpeg, we are greeted with the colors of the rainbow splashed everywhere.
Definitely not the image that was seen in the thumbnail.

I tried zooming into the thumbnail and guessed the flag from what I could make out.
This is not the intended solution, however. 
Knowing that image thumbnails are sometimes stored as metadata, that was my next move.

I used `exiftool` to view the metadata.
> `exiftool fm01.jpg`

And in the output, we see the flag:
```
History When                    : 2021:03:12 13:28:07Z, 2021:03:12 13:28:07Z
History Software Agent          : Adobe Photoshop 22.2 (Windows), Adobe Photoshop 22.2 (Windows)
History Changed                 : /, /
Text Layer Name                 : flag: tr4il3r_p4rk
Text Layer Text                 : flag: tr4il3r_p4rk
Document Ancestors              : E25BCF5D355B2F2CE5EB55EC6B67C7AF
Image Width                     : 1920
Image Height                    : 1295
```
The flag has been confirmed through the exif data, in addition to what can be seen in the thumbnail.
```
FLAG: tr4il3r_p4rk
```
