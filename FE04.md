## Challenge

> You are given a `50k-users.txt` list. Then, get the one username using the criteria:
> 
> "The username you are looking for has x as the 3rd character, followed immediately by a number from 2 to 6,
>  it has a Z character in it, and the last character is S."

## Solution
I did this in three steps. Part one was to use `grep` to grab every string with x as the 3rd character.
> `grep -e "^..x" 50k-users.txt > less-users1.txt`

From here, I used `awk` to get this down further. This could be done in one command, but I used two.
> `awk '/S$/{print}' less-users1.txt >> less-users2.txt`
This singled it down to only those with S at the end.

> `awk '/[Z]/{print}' less-users2.txt >> less-users3.txt`
This made sure that only strings containing Z were left.

At this point, you can either guess-and-check, or you can find the string with a number below 6 after x.
Either way, you're done!
