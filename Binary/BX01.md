## Challenge

> You are to access a network endpoint `cfta-bx01.allyourbases.co` with port `8012`\
> "Format a valid request" is all further information provided.
## Solution
Contacting the service through `netcat` gives us our first clue.\
`nc cfta-bx01.allyourbases.co 8012`

The "angle brackets not terminated" hints at needing angle brackets as part of the solution.\
So, angle brackets!\

Next idea, hit it with a bunch of brackets using Python.\
`python -c "print('>'*1000)" | nc cfta-bx01.allyourbases.co 8012`\

Too many brackets, huh? After some trial and error, 300 did the trick.\
`python -c "print('>'*300)" | nc cfta-bx01.allyourbases.co 8012`\

And there's the flag!
