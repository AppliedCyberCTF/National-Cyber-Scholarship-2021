>
> The program allows you to enter a string, and responds with an obfuscated string.

At this point, `aLittLeObfuScatIonalCha` was enough to guess that the last part would be some variation of `Character`.
Guessing gave me `aLittLeObfuScatIonalCharActEr`, and there was the flag!

FLAG: aLittLeObfuScatIonalCharActEr
