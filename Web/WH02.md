Visiting the site we're greeted with this page:

The first time I looked at this challenge I thought it was basically impossible or something and closed it. I came back to it an hour later and then actually decided to look at the text on the site. 
```
Use consistent indentation.
Follow the DRY principle.
Avoid deep nesting.
Limit line length.
Avoid putting all your code into one or two files.
Consistent naming conventions.

```

**Use Version control**

I saw that and had a revelation. 

https://cfta-wh02.allyourbases.co/.git/

IT WAS A GIT REPO??????!!!!!!

However running `git clone https://cfta-wh02.allyourbases.co/.git/` wasn't working, I did a little bit of googling on how to grab repos from websites and found [this](https://blog.jakubjuszczak.de/writeup-ctf-0x00sec-web-exercise-1/) writeup. 

Using this command: `wget -r --no-parent --connect-timeout=5 https://cfta-wh02.allyourbases.co/.git/`, I was able to cleanly clone the repo. 

Ran the following commands:
```bash
cd cfta-wh02.allyourbases.co
git log -p
```

LOL
