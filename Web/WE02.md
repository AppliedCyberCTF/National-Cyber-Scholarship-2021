## Challenge

> Go to website https://cfta-we02.allyourbases.co/ and get the flag.
## Solution
The site is pretty bland, there's not much to do here. 
I tried to use my web crawler to copy the site to disk, and it came across `robots.txt`.
Within this file, there is a [html](https://cfta-we02.allyourbases.co/4ext6b6.html) file that is disallowed. 
I went and checked it out manually, there was the flag!\
